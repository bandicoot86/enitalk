        <p>Hello. My name is Anton and I am a founder of Enitalk. I want to thank you for your interest in Enitalk and can say we are very excited to have you on board.</p>
        <p>We set a high bar for the teachers to join but we take away all the mundane work and we treat every teacher as a member of a team, so they can feel at home.     
        <p>With no further ado, let me describe what we do next:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Please, reply to this email, telling us more about your experience</li>
            <li>Do you have a short video introducing you to the world as a teacher?</li>
            <li>Do you have any certificates, like TEFL?</li>
            <li>How long have you been teaching?</li>
            <li>Any particular field you excel in, for instance business English, preparing for exams, teaching kids?</li>
            <li>Please, provide a suitable time (with timezone offset) for us to have a chat in Skype. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>It is a short list and we would like to know more. Let's schedule a Skype session, shall we? My personal skype is anton.krash1 and my email is ceo@enitalk.com. Please, contact me any time of day and night. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
